This is an attempt at learning python in a fun way. It is not an attempt to
create sustainable open source. You've been warned. :)

This is, when finished, a TUI "screen saver" that displays fireworks or
snowflakes on the terminal. It will display them until `q` or Ctrl+C are
pressed and is designed to work with `tmux`, etc, to provide some bling on your
terminal when you only need half of it.

Packaging is probably going to be a mess because I'm a python newbie. Patches
would be welcome here once the project boots as it'd be a good way for me to
experience best practices, but until then chances are you're gonna have your
work cut out for you.
